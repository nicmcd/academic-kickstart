I was a lead architect on design of a new high-performance network designed for large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) systems and massively parallel memory-driven computing (MDC) systems. I was the key designer of the Gen-Z routing architectural specification. Using a data-driven simulation approach I guided the design of a novel multi-chip module (MCM) switch architecture that utilizes co-packaged integrated photonics.
